        <h1>What we do</h1>

        <section>
            <h3>Learn</h3>
            <p>A child learns in many ways - questioning adults, collaborating with peers, and experiencing the world through his or her unique perspective.

                Shiv Nadar School transforms these ways of learning into a methodology of relevance. This means that every child at our schools is equipped with a toolkit of concepts, skills and knowledge, which he or she can shape into endless possibilities and solutions. In a dynamic and shifting world, this kind of learning impacts individual growth as well as global consciousness.

                We drive academic excellence in the classroom and the pursuit of passion outside it. Our children learn to observe, analyze, interpret information, and ask 'why?' and 'what if?' They are given the opportunity to connect their lessons with what is happening in the real world, to be leaders, to take action, and to effect change in their community. They learn how to think, not what to think — and we believe that's the best way to be prepared for life in the 21st century.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Explore</h3>
            <p>We revel in creating progressive, value-oriented learning experiences for our students: essentially this is our MISSION in ACTION. Through these experiences and programmes, the ethics and values that we ascribe to find tangible manifestation, and make subtle inroads into the character of our students.

                At the end of the year-long journey our students undertake through AHA!, they showcase their discoveries of their inner artist at Anandam. The vibrant display of paintings, sculptures and artworks prepared by students, along with presentations of theatre, music and dance is a highlight of the school year.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Inovate</h3>
            <p>Our innovative curriculum enables our students to not only use the latest technology in the best ways, but redesign it, interpret it, comment on it, and very often, surprise us with original forms of it. This is the path to becoming pioneering creators of new and emerging technologies. We also push our students to see technology not just as an end, but also as potential means for bridging social and economic gaps.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Evolve</h3>
            <p>Shiv Nadar School Career Guidance Centre (CGC) was set up in 2015 as non-judgmental, open-minded space to connect and collaborate with students to make them future ready in the ways that best resonate with each child's personality. The CGC gives concrete shape to students' goals and interests, options for higher studies and ultimately, career choices, in a supportive environment.

                The CGC has a clear mandate to create a cadre of young people well-equipped to decide their paths forward into the world beyond school. For this, it offers the best opportunities, practices, experiences and opinions. It provides excellent tools, programmes and platforms so that children make confident and informed choices.</p>

            <h3>Extra Curricular Activities</h3>
            <p>We believe that "extra-curricular" is not the appropriate term to describe non-academic interventions in a school. Music, Dance, Art, Sport and club activities are essential ingredients for the development of life skills among children to help them be prepared for the challenges of the future. Our "AHA!" time happens every day for a period of one & half hours which is spent in two optional disciplines depending on the child's aptitude and interest to allow her to know her interests, and help her excel in her chosen area over the years by rigorous, joyous and many hours of creative engagement with peers who enjoy the same interests. These could vary from Sport disciplines to the Arts; Science to Humanitarian engagement. More details of the program will be available through the school team at the time of admission enquiry.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Quality of Faculty</h3>
            <p>Great care is taken in the way we recruit our teachers - who we believe are the pillars of a great school. Along with the requisite academic and professional qualifications love of children, love of learning and passion for the job are essential qualifications to be a Shiv Nadar School teacher. We believe that the right attitude is of great importance.

                To ensure that we select educators with the right attitude, we have put in place multiple processes for the recruitment of teachers. It involves a deeply self-reflective application form, multiple psychometric tests, and three levels of interviews by experts.

                The pre-service includes 80 hours of training to hone skills, and develop a thorough understanding of the curriculum and the ability to teach in a Shiv Nadar school classroom. All teachers are on a year's probation before they are confirmed as a regular teacher to ensure that we retain the very best. Understanding the best uses of technology, interpersonal and communication skills are also key skills of the teachers at Shiv Nadar Schools.</p>

            <h3>Initiatives</h3>
            <p>The Shiv Nadar Foundation’s initiatives in Education began in 1995 with the establishment of the SSN group of institutions in Chennai, 16 years ago. It is one of India’s premier private engineering colleges.
                In 2008, The Shiv Nadar Foundation established the first VidyaGyan School in Bulandshahr near Greater NOIDA on a 15 acre campus. The second VidyaGyan School has started at Sitapur in 2013. These schools are an opportunity for bright, economically less privileged children to get quality education on full scholarship in a boarding school environment. Click here to watch a delightful video on VidyaGyan.

                Their recent venture, the Shiv Nadar University is established on a 300-acre campus just off Greater NOIDA which started its first academic program in August 2011. It is a unique multidisciplinary University - a first of its kind in India. Click here to know more.</p>

            <h3>MS. SHASHI BANERJEE</h3>
            <h3>Principal's Message</h3>
            <p>Co-creating a habitat of Learning for the New Age Learner is the most engaging, enriching and empowering engagement a community undertakes. We are privileged to invite you as partners in this endeavour. These are special times. The melting octaves of a maturing democracy create a symphony of a myriad moods, a New India emerges, an India that is witnessing an Innovations movement. Innovations have been a part of Indian heritage and tradition- from the improvisation of breathing to the synthesis of mind and body systems, from the discovery of zero and the decimal system to being the cradle of an ancient civilisation and major world religions, from being home to the first global Universities such as Nalanda and Takshila, to architectural and engineering marvels. Innovations in technology, governance and business models are the key drivers of change in the present times have unleashed a revolution in the field of education as much as in other fields of human endeavour. But humanity at large needs a resuscitation of values.

                What then is the fundamental role of a school in nurturing humanity?
                How do we raise children who contribute towards making the world a better place?
                If our children are to shape a world of their dreams, what kinds of knowledge and skills are most important for them to learn?
                Which are the conditions under which they learn best?

                The pursuit of answers to these and a host of questions that concern the true purpose of education "attainment of peace, freedom, justice and therefore happiness for self and others" will guide the processes and practices of our School.

                For us, every child is a soul in evolution, a psychic being born on earth to grow through experiences and fulfill a deeper sense of purpose. Our task then as teachers is to relate to this spark- the child- with love, and to serve it. Our task is to nourish the seed, and the plant will bloom as it chooses. The mind must be consulted in its growth. Values are the water, the soil, the air and the sun with which we nourish the plant. For we believe, nothing can be taught, all knowledge exists within us, it only needs to be uncovered.

                With this as an invocation and a commitment , we, caretakers, facilitators , and, essentially all of us co- learners, welcome you to this mindful laboratory of learning- a universe that pulsates with the dreams and aspirations of each aspirant who is or aspires to be a new Buddha, a Gandhi, a Ramanujam, an Aryabhatta, a Michael Angelo, a CV Raman, a Bismillah khan, a Satyajit Ray, a Florence Nightingale, a Pele, a Laxmibai, a Meera, a Kalam, a Rahman, a Spielberg or for that matter a Shiv Nadar, to make a difference to the world we live in , now and beyond!</p>

            <h3>MS. MONICA SAGAR</h3>
            <h3>Principal's Message</h3>
            <p>At Shiv Nadar School, the term "school" has a different meaning. The school for us is a Sensitive(S) and Child-centric(C) environment fostering Critical enquiry, which is like a 'Home(H)' away from home, where the children develop a love for Life-long learning(L) through Observation(O) and experience, to become Outstanding(O) human beings. Our endeavour is to create responsible global citizens who are agents of change, who are strong and resilient yet flexible in the changing fortunes of time.

                Learning at Shiv Nadar School is experiential at all levels. We believe in the community approach and parents are called upon to contribute to the growth and development of the child. We welcome students from diverse backgrounds and offer them a rich and rigorous interdisciplinary curriculum designed to inspire creativity and critical enquiry.

                Our core values of integrity and loyalty, commitment to excellence, openness and transparency, life-long learning, respect and compassion and a sense of responsibility and purpose, define everything that we do. These are imbibed in our staff through an intensive induction programme, continuous orientation, and through a style of leadership that is empathetic, action-oriented, and inspires passion for excellence.</p>

            <h3>MS. ANJU WAL</h3>
            <h3>Principal's Message</h3>
            <p>The pivotal reason to establish this progressive school in the fascinating city of Faridabad, the blend of tradition and modern seamlessly knitted into the fabric of the place, is to build a hub of creativity where divergent thinking and life skills are constructed in the being of every child. Our commitment is deep rooted and diligently crafted. We want to empower our children to live life with respect, courage, compassion and have competencies to trod any path they choose to. To armour them with a strong value system and code of ethics to ensure that each child internalizes the core principles of integrity and basic human goodness. That each Shiv Nadar School child becomes the ambassador of the school and goes forth in life with pride and unbridled joy.

                What we don’t need to do is teach our children skills based on specific jobs. Most of the jobs our children will do haven’t been invented yet, or may not look anything like they do today. So we really don’t know what they’ll be doing or how they’ll be doing it.

                Instead, we want to teach them how to see problems clearly, ask really good questions, think with creativity and imagination, communicate through words, pictures, sound, and motion, and more. The Shiv Nadar scholar will graduate from the threshold of the school with the ability to sift and sieve information, analyse, interpret, infer, resolve problems, make decisions and be a team person. He/ She will have a self worth and the confidence to take on any task with élan. He/she will never buckle under pressure and cope with the vagaries of the world with equanimity without losing his zest and vigour for life.

                Some institutions are born to bring transformational changes in the way we look at Education and ways to learn. Shiv Nadar School is clearly one such institution. This will be an incredible journey for your child. Come, team with us.</p>
